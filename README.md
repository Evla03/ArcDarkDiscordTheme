# Arc Dark Discord theme

This is a BetterDiscord port of the color scheme and theme Arc Dark. 
Create an issue if anything looks wrong or if you have any suggestions.

The arc_dark.theme.css is currently sort of broken, but my new arc_dark_translucent.theme.css sort of works.
I made it for use with KWin + ForceBlur and BetterDiscord with "Enable Translucency" enabled.
